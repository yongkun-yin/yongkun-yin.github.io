                  Male-biased sex ratios (the missing women) and gender education gaps in some developing countries have raised much concern. Why do parents favor sons over daughters? What policies are effective in reducing son preference? To answer these questions, an overlapping-generation model of fertility, sex selection, the quantity-quality trade-off, and marriage is built and estimated for India. The quantitative analysis reveals that the main drivers of son preference are economic factors, i.e., old-age support by sons, dowry payment for daughters, and labor market discrimination against women. If the gender differences in the economic factors are removed, the male-female ratio at birth (or sex ratio at birth, SRB) would reduce from 1.139 to 1.052. The fertility rate would drop from 3.07 to 2.40, and the share of women with secondary education would increase from 49.2% to 72.1%. Once the economic factors become symmetric for sons and daughters, eliminating intrinsic son preference has a small additional effect. Prohibiting prenatal sex selection could normalize the sex ratio, but it lowers educational attainment for women. A subsidy for female births or a subsidy for female education can reduce the SRB. But the former increases fertility and reduces children's education and women's labor supply, while the latter has opposite effects. Finally, a pay-as-you-go pension system can lower the SRB to 1.092, but it also reduces children's educational attainment, as parents value them now less.

                  <summary> Abstract </summary>
                  China's fertility decline was very fast. But the drivers of this decline are not well understood. The common wisdom attributes it to the strict population control policies, particularly the One-Child Policy. Yet, fertility decline might also be due to the spectacular economic transformation and substantial mortality decline. To quantify the effects of different factors on China's demographic and economic transition, I develop a two-sector overlapping-generation model with workers' movement from rural to urban areas and endogenous fertility and education choices. Quantitative analysis shows that even without any population policy, the total fertility rate (TFR) would decline from 6.25 children around 1950 to 2.75 children around 2010. However, the population policies were crucial for TFR to fall below the replacement level and do so very quickly after the 1980s. By around 2010, the cumulative effect of population policies reduced fertility from 2.75 to 1.31 children. The baseline model is also extended to incorporate the hukou system, considering that different hukou types are linked to different child quotas under the One-Child Policy and government transfers. The extended model suggests that the impact of the hukou system on fertility decisions was relatively minor.

                  This study examines the effects of children's sex on women's sex preferences and investigates the underlying mechanisms. Women's sex preference is measured by the proportion of sons and daughters they would like to have. Based on data from a national representative sample of Peruvian women in the Demographic and Health Survey, we find that if the first child is a daughter, the ideal proportion of sons will be lower by 6.2 percentage points (pp), and the ideal proportion of daughters will be higher by 5.3 pp. Moreover, if the first two children are daughters, the ideal proportion of sons will be lower by 8.9 pp, and the ideal proportion of daughters will be higher by 6.2 pp. Further analysis shows that the effects of the sex of the first child are stronger for women with only one child than for women with multiple children and that the effects of having a daughter depend on her birth order, suggesting that both preference adaptation and learning play important roles in generating the effects of children's sex on parental sex preference.

                  This study examines the causal effect of the number of siblings on fertility decisions. I exploit the population control policies in China, which affected individuals unequally across birth cohorts and regions. The exogenous variation in fertility is used to identify the effect of the number of siblings on the number of children for the next generation. The results show that a couple tends to have 0.033-0.068 more children (2.1-4.3% of the average number of children) and is 2.4-5.6 percentage points more likely to violate the OCP (8.0-19.4% of the violation rate) if the husband and the wife have one more sibling each. Moreover, the effect on fertility is stronger for couples in rural areas where the One-Child Policy was enforced less strictly. Further analysis reveals that ideal family size, especially that of the wife, is an important channel through which the number of siblings affects fertility. These findings provide causal evidence for intergenerational transmission of fertility, identify the role of preference formation in the process, and help to understand the long-term effect of population policies.
